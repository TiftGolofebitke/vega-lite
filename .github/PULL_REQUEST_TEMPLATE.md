Please:
- Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- Provide a test case & update the documentation under `site/docs/`
- All existing lint and test should pass. (Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test`)
- Make sure you have merged/rebased `master` into your branch. 
- Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note. 
  - Use imperative mood and present tense (Read why: http://stackoverflow.com/q/13861318/).
  - Mention relevant issues. (e.g., `#1` for issue #1)
  - Focus on WHAT and WHY rather than how.
  - See more tips about git commit: http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/.

vegalite
========

A high-level grammar for visual analysis, built on top of Vega.
Vegalite provides ease-of-use comparable to tools like ggplot or
Tableau, but generates full-featured Vega specifications as output.

Vegalite specifications consist of simple mappings of variables in
a data set to visual encoding channels such as position (x,y),
size, color and shape. These mappings are then translated into
full visualization specifications using the Vega visualization
grammar. These resulting visualizations can then be exported or
further modified to customize the display.

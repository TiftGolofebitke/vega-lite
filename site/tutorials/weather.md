** This tutorial is work in progress **

<!--

In this tutorial, you'll learn a few more techniques for creating visualizations in Vega-Lite. If you are not familiar with Vega-Lite, read the [getting started tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/getting_started.html) first.

Let's say you have some dataset about weather data in Seattle, WA that you want to visualize. The [dataset] is a simple CSV file with columns for the temperature, precipitation, wind, and weather type.

* **AWND** - Average daily wind speed (tenths of meters per second)
* **TOBS** - Temperature at the time of observation (tenths of degrees C)
* **TMAX** - Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
* **TMIN** - Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
* **PRCP** - Precipitation (tenths of mm)

* **WT14** - Drizzle
* **WT03** - Thunder
* **WT04** - Ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets, or small hail"
* **WT05** - Hail (may include small hail)
* **WT16** - Rain (may include freezing rain, drizzle, and freezing drizzle)"
* **WT17** - Freezing rain
* **WT18** - Snow, snow pellets, snow grains, or ice crystals
* **WT08** - Smoke or haze
* **WT11** - High or damaging winds
* **WT22** - Ice fog or freezing fog
* **WT01** - Fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include heavy fog)
* **WT02** - Heavy fog or heaving freezing fog (not always distinguished from fog)
* **WT13** - Mist
